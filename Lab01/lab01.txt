1. The RTT between 113.197.15.99 and 113.197.15.201 increases from ~3 ms to ~97 ms.
   There are 21 routers before I get consistent timeouts.

2. The reverse path goes through a different path. The trace from Singapore spend goes
   through much more of the UNSW network than mine. The same is true for Telstra.
   This may be due to switches only taking traffic from one direction (core-bound or edge-bound).

3. 	Distance(km)	Min. Time (ms)
   UQ   730             2.43
   NUS	6310		21.0
   TU   16110		53.7

   The delay appears to be fairly inconsistent except it does increase very slightly as the packet size increases.
   Processing delay is minimal.
   Transmission delay increases with the size of the packet. this could be the source of the slight increase in delay with packet size.
   Propagation delay is constant.
   Therefore the source of the change in delay must be queueing. Traffic is unpredictable and most likely responsible for the wide range in delays.
